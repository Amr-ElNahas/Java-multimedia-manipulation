What is Multimedia?
People who use the term �multimedia� may have quite different, even opposing, viewpoints. A consumer entertainment vendor, say a phone company, may think of multimedia as interactive TV with hundreds of digital channels, or a cable-TV-like service delivered over a high-speed Internet connection. A hardware vendor might, on the other hand, like us to think of multimedia as a laptop that has good sound capability and perhaps the superiority of multimedia-enabled microprocessors that understand additional multimedia instructions.

A computer science or engineering student reading this book likely has a more application-oriented view of what multimedia consists of: applications that use multiple modalities to their advantage, including text, images, drawings, graphics, animation, video, sound (including speech), and, most likely, interactivity of some kind. This contrasts with media that use only rudimentary computer displays such as text-only or traditional forms of printed or hand-produced material.

The popular notion of �convergence� is one that inhabits the college campus as it does the culture at large. In this scenario, computers, smartphones, games, digital TV, multimedia-based search, and so on are converging in technology, presumably to arrive in the near future at a final and fully functional all-round, multimedia-enabled product. While hardware may indeed strive for such all-round devices, the present is already exciting�multimedia is part of some of the most interesting projects underway in computer science, with the keynote being interactivity. The convergence going on in this field is in fact a convergence of areas that have in the past been separated but are now finding much to share in this new application area. Graphics, visualization, HCI, computer vision, data compression, graph theory, networking, database systems�all have important contributions to make in multimedia at the present time.
